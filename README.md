# GSH_EDT_AE
Clustering Algorithm for AM Parts using GSH and EDT with Autoencoder

A novel data-driven method for material microstructure quantification that improves sensitivity to microstructural changes compared to traditional approaches. This method integrates multiple microstructural properties, including grain morphology, crystallographic orientation, and material phase information. This approach employs generalized spherical harmonic mapping for crystallographic orientations, per-pixel phase information, and a variational autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and results in a multidimensional clustering of by microstructure similarity. Applied to an experimental dataset of additively manufactured steel, the method detected slight variations in samples produced under nominally identical processing conditions. It distinguished between samples between samples rotated by 45 degrees on the build plate, samples from different (nominally identical) builds, and an outlier microstructure. The improved sensitivity of this method, demonstrated through comparisonwith traditional microstructure characterization techniques, offers advantages for microstructure quantification and comparisons in advanced manufacturing applications.
